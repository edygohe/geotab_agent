# System Architecture: Geotab Add-In Generator

This document outlines the multi-agent system architecture for the automated generation of Geotab Add-Ins.

## Flow Diagram

The system follows a sequential workflow managed by an Orchestrator Agent, with feedback loops for quality assurance. The communication protocol between agents is MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol).

## Agent Responsibilities

*   **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages the overall workflow, communicates with the LLM, and delegates tasks to specialist agents.
*   **Analyst Agent**: Transforms the user's request into detailed functional specifications.
*   **Designer Agent**: Creates the technical architecture and UI/UX design based on the specifications.
*   **Coder Agent**: Writes the source code based on the technical design.
*   **Tester Agent**: Validates the generated code against specifications and reports bugs.
*   **Deployer Agent**: Packages the final code for deployment.
